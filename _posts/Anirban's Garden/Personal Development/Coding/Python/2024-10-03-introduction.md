Python is a fantastic language to learn. The volume of functionalities that can be performed by using this programing language is beyond the scope of any book that is available in the market. However, if one has a strong understanding of the core principles, then the learning new topics becomes a breeze. Python is not difficult. In fact, most of the syntax and flow resembles general English. So sit back and relax as we delve into this wonderful journey of learning Python.

I am not going to bog you down with how to setup Python in your computer. There are lots of videos on the YouTube that can help you with that.
