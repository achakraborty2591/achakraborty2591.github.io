But, it is always advisable by the python gurus that file name should be meaningful and must match with the purpose of the code it contains. Lets look at the contents of the file -

```python
"""
This code prints 'Hello World!' to the console.
"""

print("Hello World!")
```

**Hello World**

Let us breakdown the entire the process in small steps - 
1. In order to execute the python code we need to use the terminal in Mac and use the command - **python3 <path_to_the_code>/hello_world_001.py**.
2.
